AI Medical Prescription Analysis System

--> Objective:
     Develop a comprehensive Python-based AI medical prescription system that leverages IBM Watson and Hugging Face models to analyze drug             interactions, provide dosage recommendations, and offer safe medication alternatives through intelligent prescription scanning and analysis.

--> Description:
     This project aims to revolutionize medical prescription management by analyzing drug interactions through user-inputted medicine prescriptions via scanner technology. The system identifies correct drug dosages, provides safe alternative medication options based on patient age and drug details, integrates e-commerce platforms for online medicine ordering, and maintains hospital contact databases. The solution integrates multiple medical datasets and leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and APIs for accurate drug information extraction and interaction understanding. The system architecture features a FastAPI backend for robust API management and a Streamlit frontend for intuitive user interaction.
